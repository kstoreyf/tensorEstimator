abstract = {Intrinsically bright galaxies appear systematically more correlated than faint galaxies in the Center for Astrophysics redshift survey. The amplification of the 2-point correlation function behaves exponentially with luminosity, being essentially flat up to the knee of the luminosity function, then increasing markedly. The amplification reaches a factor of 3.5e ±0 * 4 in the very brightest galaxies. The effect is dominated by spirals rather than ellipticals, so that the correlation function of bright spirals becomes comparable to that of normal ellipticals. Similar results are obtained whether the correlation function is measured in two or three dimensions. The effect persists to separations of a correlation length or more, and is not confined to the cores of the Virgo, Coma, and Abell 1367 clusters, suggesting that the effect is caused by biasing, that is, galaxies kindle preferentially in more clustered regions, rather than by gravitational relaxation.},

@article{Kerscher1998,
abstract = {Second-order measures, such as the two-point correlation function, are geometrical quantities describing the clustering properties of a point distribution. In this article well-known estimators for the correlation integral are reviewed and their relation to geometrical estimators for the two-point correlation function is put forward. Simulations illustrate the range of applicability of these estimators. The interpretation of the two-point correlation function as the excess of clustering with respect to Poisson distributed points has led to biases in common estimators. Comparing with the approximately unbiased geometrical estimators, we show how biases enter the estimators introduced by Davis and Peebles, Landy and Szalay, and Hamilton. We give recommendations for the application of the estimators, including details of the numerical implementation. The properties of the estimators of the correlation integral are illustrated in an application to a sample of IRAS galaxies. It is found that, due to the limitations of current galaxy catalogues in number and depth, no reliable determination of the correlation integral on large scales is possible. In the sample of IRAS galaxies considered, several estimators using different finite-size corrections yield different results on scales larger than 20 Mpc/h, while all of them agree on smaller scales.},

@article{Demina2016,
abstract = {We developed a modification to the calculation of the two-point correlation function commonly used in the analysis of large scale structure in cosmology. An estimator of the two-point correlation function is constructed by contrasting the observed distribution of galaxies with that of a uniformly populated random catalog. Using the assumption that the distribution of random galaxies in redshift is independent of angular position allows us to replace pairwise combinatorics with fast integration over probability maps. The new method significantly reduces the computation time while simultaneously increasing the precision of the calculation. It also allows to introduce cosmological parameters only at the last and least computationally expensive stage, which is helpful when exploring various choices for these parameters.},

The problem of estimating the acceleration vector from a magnitude-limited redshift survey and the anisotropy of the galaxy clustering patterns are studied, restricting attention to large scales for which linear theory should be applicable. The determination of the density parameter from the Galaxy's infall to the local supercluster is addressed, and the influence of peculiar velocities on the morphology of clustering in the transition between the linear and nonlinear regimes is investigated.},

@article{VargasMagana2013,
abstract = {Measuring the two-point correlation function of the galaxies in the Universe gives access to the underlying dark matter distribution, which is related to cosmological parameters and to the physics of the primordial Universe. The estimation of the correlation function for current galaxy surveys makes use of the Landy-Szalay estimator, which is supposed to reach minimal variance. This is only true, however, for a vanishing correlation function. We study the Landy-Szalay estimator when these conditions are not fulfilled and propose a new estimator that provides the smallest variance for a given survey geometry. Our estimator is a linear combination of ratios between paircounts of data and/or random catalogues (DD, RR and DR). The optimal combination for a given geometry is determined by using lognormal mock catalogues. The resulting estimator is biased in a model-dependent way, but we propose a simple iterative procedure for obtaining an unbiased model-independent estimator. Our method can be easily applied to any dataset and requires few extra mock catalogues compared to the standard Landy-Szalay analysis. Using various sets of simulated data (lognormal, second-order LPT and N-Body), we obtain a 20-25{\%} gain on the error bars on the two-point correlation function for the SDSS geometry and $\Lambda$CDM correlation function. When applied to SDSS data (DR7 and DR9), we achieve a similar gain on the correlation functions, which translates into a 10-15{\%} improvement over the estimation of the densities of matter Ωm and dark energy Ω$\Lambda$ in an open $\Lambda$CDM model. The constraints derived from DR7 data with our estimator are similar to those obtained with the DR9 data and the Landy-Szalay estimator, which covers a volume twice as large and has a density that is three times higher.},

abstract = {We examine the correlation function $\xi$ of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Luminous Red Galaxy sample at large scales (60 h -1 Mpc {\textless} s {\textless} 400 h -1 Mpc) using the final data release (DR7). Focusing on a quasi-volume-limited (0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.36) subsample and utilizing mock galaxy catalogs, we demonstrate that the observed baryonic acoustic peak and larger scale signal are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM at 70{\%}-95{\%} confidence. Fitting data to a non-linear, redshift-space, template-based model, we constrain the peak position at s p = 101.7± 3.0 h -1 Mpc when fitting the range 60 h -1 Mpc {\textless} s {\textless} 150 h -1 Mpc (1$\sigma$ uncertainties). This redshift-space distance s p is related to the comoving sound horizon scale rs after taking into account matter-clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions, and galaxy-clustering bias. Mock catalogs show that the probability that a DR7-sized sample would not have an identifiable peak is at least {\~{}}10{\%}. As a consistency check of a fiducial cosmology, we use the observed s p to obtain the distance D{\_}V≡ ((1+z){\^{}}2D{\_}A{\^{}}2cz/H(z)){\^{}}{\{}{\{}1{\}}/{\{}3{\}}{\}} relative to the acoustic scale. We find rs /DV (z = 0.278) = 0.1389 ± 0.0043. This result is in excellent agreement with Percival et al., who examine roughly the same data set, but use the power spectrum. Comparison with other determinations in the literature are also in very good agreement. The signal of the full sample at 125 h -1 Mpc {\textless} s {\textless} 200 h -1 Mpc tends to be high relative to theoretical expectations; this slight deviation can probably be attributed to sample variance. We have tested our results against a battery of possible systematic effects, finding all effects are smaller than our estimated sample variance.},

abstract = {We present the large-scale correlation function measured from a spectroscopic sample of 46,748 luminous red galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The survey region covers 0.72 h{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}} Gpc{\^{}}3 over 3816 square degrees and 0.16{\textless}z{\textless}0.47, making it the best sample yet for the study of large-scale structure. We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z=1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4{\%} fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5{\%} accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Omega{\_}mh{\^{}}2 to 8{\%} and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Omega{\_}m = 0.273 +- 0.025 + 0.123 (1+w{\_}0) + 0.137 Omega{\_}K. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is Omega{\_}K=-0.010+-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

The ML estimator outperforms the LS estimator in that it results in smaller measurement errors at any fixed random point density. Put another way, the ML estimator can reach the same precision as the LS estimator with a significantly smaller random point catalog. Moreover, these gains are achieved without significantly increasing the computational requirements for estimating {\{}$\backslash$xi{\}}. We quantify the relative improvement of the ML estimator over the LS estimator, and discuss the regimes under which these improvements are most significant. We present a short guide on how to implement the ML estimator, and emphasize that the code alterations required to switch from a LS to a ML estimator are minimal.},

We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction Ω b /Ω 0 ∼ {\textgreater} Ω 0 h 2 + 0.2, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter $\Gamma$.

The estimators were ranked by the cumulative probability of returning a value within a certain tolerance of the real correlation function. This criterion takes into account bias and variance, and it is independent of the possibly non-Gaussian nature of the error statistics.
