abstract = {Second-order measures, such as the two-point correlation function, are geometrical quantities describing the clustering properties of a point distribution. In this article well-known estimators for the correlation integral are reviewed and their relation to geometrical estimators for the two-point correlation function is put forward. Simulations illustrate the range of applicability of these estimators. The interpretation of the two-point correlation function as the excess of clustering with respect to Poisson distributed points has led to biases in common estimators. Comparing with the approximately unbiased geometrical estimators, we show how biases enter the estimators introduced by Davis and Peebles, Landy and Szalay, and Hamilton. We give recommendations for the application of the estimators, including details of the numerical implementation. The properties of the estimators of the correlation integral are illustrated in an application to a sample of IRAS galaxies. It is found that, due to the limitations of current galaxy catalogues in number and depth, no reliable determination of the correlation integral on large scales is possible. In the sample of IRAS galaxies considered, several estimators using different finite-size corrections yield different results on scales larger than 20 Mpc/h, while all of them agree on smaller scales.},

abstract = {We examine the correlation function $\xi$ of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Luminous Red Galaxy sample at large scales (60 h -1 Mpc {\textless} s {\textless} 400 h -1 Mpc) using the final data release (DR7). Focusing on a quasi-volume-limited (0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.36) subsample and utilizing mock galaxy catalogs, we demonstrate that the observed baryonic acoustic peak and larger scale signal are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM at 70{\%}-95{\%} confidence. Fitting data to a non-linear, redshift-space, template-based model, we constrain the peak position at s p = 101.7± 3.0 h -1 Mpc when fitting the range 60 h -1 Mpc {\textless} s {\textless} 150 h -1 Mpc (1$\sigma$ uncertainties). This redshift-space distance s p is related to the comoving sound horizon scale rs after taking into account matter-clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions, and galaxy-clustering bias. Mock catalogs show that the probability that a DR7-sized sample would not have an identifiable peak is at least {\~{}}10{\%}. As a consistency check of a fiducial cosmology, we use the observed s p to obtain the distance D{\_}V≡ ((1+z){\^{}}2D{\_}A{\^{}}2cz/H(z)){\^{}}{\{}{\{}1{\}}/{\{}3{\}}{\}} relative to the acoustic scale. We find rs /DV (z = 0.278) = 0.1389 ± 0.0043. This result is in excellent agreement with Percival et al., who examine roughly the same data set, but use the power spectrum. Comparison with other determinations in the literature are also in very good agreement. The signal of the full sample at 125 h -1 Mpc {\textless} s {\textless} 200 h -1 Mpc tends to be high relative to theoretical expectations; this slight deviation can probably be attributed to sample variance. We have tested our results against a battery of possible systematic effects, finding all effects are smaller than our estimated sample variance.},

abstract = {We present cosmological results from the final galaxy clustering data set of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our combined galaxy sample comprises 1.2 million massive galaxies over an effective area of 9329 deg 2 and volume of 18.7 Gpc 3 , divided into three partially overlapping redshift slices centred at effective redshifts 0.38, 0.51, and 0.61. We measure the angular diameter distance D M and Hubble parameter H from the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method after applying reconstruction to reduce non-linear effects on the BAO feature. Using the anisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction density field, we measure the product D M H from the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the growth of structure, quantified by f $\sigma$ 8 (z), from redshift-space distortions (RSD). We combine individual measurements presented in seven companion papers into a set of consensus values and likelihoods, obtaining constraints that are tighter and more robust than those from any one method; in particular, the AP measurement from sub-BAO scales sharpens constraints from post-reconstruction BAO by breaking degeneracy between D M and H. Combined with Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously imply curvature $\Omega$ K = 0.0003 ± 0.0026 and a dark energy equation of state parameter w = −1.01 ± 0.06, in strong affirmation of the spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM). Our RSD measurements of f $\sigma$ 8 , at 6 per cent precision, are similarly consistent with this model. When combined with supernova Ia data, we find H 0 = 67.3 ± 1.0 km s −1 Mpc −1 even for our most general dark energy model, in tension with some direct measurements. Adding extra relativistic species as a degree of freedom loosens the constraint only slightly, to H 0 = 67.8 ± 1.2 km s −1 Mpc −1. Assuming flat $\Lambda$CDM we find $\Omega$ m = 0.310 ± 0.005 and H 0 = 67.6 ± 0.5 km s −1 Mpc −1 , and we find a 95{\%} upper limit of 0.16 eV/c 2 on the neutrino mass sum.},

abstract = {We investigate the bias and error in estimates of the cosmological parameter covariance matrix due to sampling or modelling the data covariance matrix, for likelihood width and peak scatter estimators.We show that these estimators do not coincide unless the data covariance is exactly known. For sampled data covariances with Gaussian-distributed data and parameters, the parameter covariance matrix estimated from the width of the likelihood has aWishart distribution, from which we derive the mean and covariance. This mean is biased and we propose an unbiased estimator of the parameter covariance matrix. Comparing our analytic results to a numerical Wishart sampler of the data covariance matrix we find excellent agreement. An accurate ansatz for the mean parameter covariance for the peak scatter estimator is found, and we fit its covariance to our numerical analysis. The mean is again biased and we propose an unbiased estimator for the peak parameter covariance. For sampled data covariances, the width estimator is more accurate than the peak scatter estimator. We investigate modelling the data covariance, or equivalently data compression, and show that the peak scatter estimator is less sensitive to biases in the model data covariance matrix than the width estimator, but requires independent realizations of the data to reduce the statistical error. If the model bias on the peak estimator is sufficiently low, this is promising, otherwise the sampled width estimator is preferable {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {We obtain constraints on cosmological parameters from the spherically averaged redshift-space correlation function of the CMASS Data Release 9 (DR9) sample of the Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We combine this information with additional data from recent cosmic microwave background (CMB), supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. Our results show no significant evidence of deviations from the standard flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, whose basic parameters can be specified by $\Omega$m = 0.285 ± 0.009, 100$\Omega$b = 4.59 ± 0.09, ns = 0.961 ± 0.009, H0 = 69.4 ± 0.8kms-1Mpc-1 and $\sigma$8 = 0.80 ± 0.02. The CMB+CMASS combination sets tight constraints on the curvature of the Universe, with $\Omega$k = -0.0043 ± 0.0049, and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio, for which we find r {\textless} 0.16 at the 95per cent confidence level (CL). These data show a clear signature of a deviation from scale invariance also in the presence of tensor modes, with ns {\textless} 1 at the 99.7per cent CL. We derive constraints on the fraction of massive neutrinos of f$\nu$ {\textless} 0.049 (95per cent CL), implying a limit of ∑m$\nu$ {\textless} 0.51eV. We find no signature of a deviation from a cosmological constant from the combination of all data sets, with a constraint of wDE = -1.033 ± 0.073 when this parameter is assumed time-independent, and no evidence of a departure from this value when it is allowed to evolve as wDE(a) = w0 + wa(1 - a). The achieved accuracy on our cosmological constraints is a clear demonstration of the constraining power of current cosmological observations. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {We present the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field derived from a sample of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Seventh Data Release (DR7). The halo power spectrum has a direct connection to the underlying dark matter power for k ≤ 0.2 h Mpc-1, well into the quasi-linear regime. This enables us to use a factor of {\~{}}8 more modes in the cosmological analysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h Mpc-1,aswas adopted in the SDSS team analysis of the DR4 LRG sample. The observed halo power spectrum for 0.02 {\textless}k{\textless}0.2 h Mpc-1 is well fitted by our model: $\chi$2 = 39.6 for 40 degrees of freedom for the best-fitting $\Delta$ cold dark matter ($\Delta$CDM) model. We find $\Omega$mh2(ns/0.96)1.2 = 0.141+0.010-0.012 for a power-law primordial power spectrum with spectral index ns and $\Omega$bh2 = 0.022 65 fixed, consistent with cosmic microwave background measurements. The halo power spectrum also constrains the ratio of the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance to z = 0.35: rs/DV(0.35) = 0.1097+0.0039-0.0042. Combining the halo power spectrum measurement with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5 year results, for the flat $\Delta$CDM model we find $\Omega$m = 0.289 ± 0.019 and H0 = 69.4 ± 1.6 km s-1 Mpc-1. Allowing ∑ for massive neutrinos in $\Delta$CDM, we find $\sigma$m$\nu$ {\textless} 0.62 eV at the 95 per cent confidence level. If we instead consider the effective number of relativistic species Neff as a free parameter, we find Neff = 4.8+1.8-1.7. Combining also with the Kowalski et al. supernova sample, we find $\Omega$tot = 1.011 ± 0.009 and w =-0.99 ± 0.11 for an open cosmology with constant dark energy equation of state w.

abstract = {Aims. The maximum-likelihood method is the standard approach to obtain model fits to observational data and the corresponding confidence regions. We investigate possible sources of bias in the log-likelihood function and its subsequent analysis, focusing on estimators of the inverse covariance matrix. Furthermore, we study under which circumstances the estimated covariance matrix is invertible. Methods. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the behaviour of estimators for the inverse covariance matrix, depending on the number of independent data sets and the number of variables of the data vectors. Results. We find that the inverse of the maximum-likelihood estimator of the covariance is biased, the amount of bias depending on the ratio of the number of bins (data vector variables), p, to the number of data sets, n. This bias inevitably leads to an - in extreme cases catastrophic - underestimation of the size of confidence regions. We report on a method to remove this bias for the idealised case of Gaussian noise and statistically independent data vectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that marginalisation over parameters introduces a bias into the marginalised log-likelihood function. Measures of the sizes of confidence regions suffer from the same problem. Furthermore, we give an analytic proof for the fact that the estimated covariance matrix is singular if p {\textgreater} n. {\textcopyright} ESO 2007.},

abstract = {We present improved methodology for including covariance matrices in the error budget of Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) galaxy clustering measurements, revisiting Data Release 9 (DR9) analyses, and describing a method that is used in DR10/11 analyses presented in companion papers. The precise analysis method adopted is becoming increasingly important, due to the precision that BOSS can now reach: even using as many as 600 mock catalogues to estimate covariance of two-point clustering measurements can still lead to an increase in the errors of ̃20 per cent, depending on how the cosmological parameters of interest are measured. In this paper, we extend previous work on this contribution to the error budget, deriving formulae for errors measured by integrating over the likelihood, and to the distribution of recovered best-fitting parameters fitting the simulations also used to estimate the covariance matrix. Both are situations that previous analyses of BOSS have considered. We apply the formulae derived to baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements from BOSS in our companion papers. To further aid these analyses, we consider the optimum number of bins to use for two-point measurements using the monopole power spectrum or correlation function for BAO, and the monopole and quadrupole moments of the correlation function for anisotropic-BAO and RSD measurements. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {Nine of the most important estimators known for the two-point correlation function are compared using a predetermined, rigorous criterion. The indicators were extracted from over 500 subsamples of the Virgo Hubble Volume simulation cluster catalog. The ``real'' correlation function was determined from the full survey in a 3000Mpc/h periodic cube. The estimators were ranked by the cumulative probability of returning a value within a certain tolerance of the real correlation function. This criterion takes into account bias and variance, and it is independent of the possibly non-Gaussian nature of the error statistics. As a result for astrophysical applications a clear recommendation has emerged: the Landy {\&} Szalay (1993) estimator, in its original or grid version Szapudi {\&} Szalay (1998), are preferred in comparison to the other indicators examined, with a performance almost indistinguishable from the Hamilton (1993) estimator.},

abstract = {We present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from the detections of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of galaxies from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our results come from the Data Release 11 (DR11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and covering approximately 8500 square degrees and the redshift range 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.7. We also compare these results with those from the publicly released DR9 and DR10 samples. Assuming a concordance $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model, the DR11 sample covers a volume of 13 Gpc3 and is the largest region of the Universe ever surveyed at this density. We measure the correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the BAO feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of over 7$\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, rd, which has a value of rd,fid = 149.28 Mpc in our fiducial cosmology. We find DV = (1264 ± 25 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.32 and DV = (2056 ± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.57. At 1.0 per cent, this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. Separating the clustering along and transverse to the line of sight yields measurements at z = 0.57 of DA = (1421 ± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) and H = (96.8 ± 3.4 kms-1 Mpc-1)(rd,fid/rd). Our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement with previous BAO measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwave background data for a spatially flat CDM model with a cosmological constant. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

@article{Sinha2019,
abstract = {The two-point correlation function (2PCF) is the most widely used tool for quantifying the spatial distribution of galaxies. Since the distribution of galaxies is determined by galaxy formation physics as well as the underlying cosmology, fitting an observed correlation function yields valuable insights into both. The calculation for a 2PCF involves computing pair-wise separations and consequently, the computing time scales quadratically with the number of galaxies. The next-generation galaxy surveys are slated to observe many millions of galaxies, and computing the 2PCF for such surveys would be prohibitively time-consuming. Additionally, modern modelling techniques require the 2PCF to be calculated thousands of times on simulated galaxy catalogues of {\{}$\backslash$em at least{\}} equal size to the data and would be completely unfeasible for the next generation surveys. Thus, calculating the 2PCF forms a substantial bottleneck in improving our understanding of the fundamental physics of the universe, and we need high-performance software to compute the correlation function. In this paper, we present Corrfunc --- a suite of highly optimised, OpenMP parallel clustering codes. The improved performance of Corrfunc arises from both efficient algorithms as well as software design that suits the underlying hardware of modern CPUs. Corrfunc can compute a wide range of 2-D and 3-D correlation functions in either simulation (Cartesian) space or on-sky coordinates. Corrfunc runs efficiently in both single- and multi-threaded modes and can compute a typical 2-point projected correlation function ({\$}w{\_}p(r{\_}p){\$}) for {\~{}}1 million galaxies within a few seconds on a single thread. Corrfunc is designed to be both user-friendly and fast and is publicly available at https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc.},

They are based upon a physically well-motivated separation of the effects of acoustic oscillations, Compton drag, velocity overshoot, baryon infall, adiabatic damping, Silk damping, and cold-dark-matter growth suppression. We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction Ω b /Ω 0 ∼ {\textgreater} Ω 0 h 2 + 0.2, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter $\Gamma$.

abstract = {Intrinsically bright galaxies appear systematically more correlated than faint galaxies in the Center for Astrophysics redshift survey. The amplification of the 2-point correlation function behaves exponentially with luminosity, being essentially flat up to the knee of the luminosity function, then increasing markedly. The amplification reaches a factor of 3.5e ±0 * 4 in the very brightest galaxies. The effect is dominated by spirals rather than ellipticals, so that the correlation function of bright spirals becomes comparable to that of normal ellipticals. Similar results are obtained whether the correlation function is measured in two or three dimensions. The effect persists to separations of a correlation length or more, and is not confined to the cores of the Virgo, Coma, and Abell 1367 clusters, suggesting that the effect is caused by biasing, that is, galaxies kindle preferentially in more clustered regions, rather than by gravitational relaxation.},

abstract = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large-scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i = 19.9 over 10,000deg2 to measure BAO to redshifts z {\textless} 0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Ly$\alpha$ forest in more than 150,000quasar spectra (g {\textless} 22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance dA to an accuracy of 1.0{\%} at redshifts z = 0.3 and z = 0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8{\%} and 1.7{\%} at the same redshifts. Forecasts for Ly$\alpha$ forest constraints predict a measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate DA (z) and H -1(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9{\%} at z ∼ 2.5 when the survey is complete. Here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopic targets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality of BOSS. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {The covariance matrices of Power-Spectrum (P(k)) measurements from galaxy surveys are difficult to compute theoretically. The current best practice is to estimate covariance matrices by computing a sample covariance of a large number of mock catalogues. The next generation of galaxy surveys will require thousands of large volume mocks to determine the covariance matrices to desired accuracy. The errors in the inverse covariance matrix are larger and scale with the number of P(k) bins, making the problem even more acute. We develop a method of estimating covariance matrices using a theoretically justified, Few-Parameter model, calibrated with mock catalogues. Using a set of 600 BOSS DR11 mock catalogues, we show that a seven parameter model is sufficient to fit the covariance matrix of BOSS DR11 P(k) measurements. The covariance computed with this method is better than the sample covariance at any number of mocks and only ∼100 mocks are required for it to fully converge and the inverse covariance matrix converges at the same rate. This method shouldwork equally well for the next generation of galaxy surveys, although a demand for higher accuracy may require adding extra parameters to the fitting function.},

Assuming a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc 3 , and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this density, ¯ n ≈ 3 × 10 −4 h −3 Mpc 3. We measure the angle-averaged galaxy correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of 5$\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II Luminous Red Galaxy Sample, the detection significance increases to 6.7$\sigma$. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance to z = 0.57 relative to the sound horizon D V /r s = 13.67 ± 0.22 at z = 0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19 Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to a distance D V (z = 0.57) = 2094 ± 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.},

We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z=1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4{\%} fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5{\%} accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Omega{\_}mh{\^{}}2 to 8{\%} and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Omega{\_}m = 0.273 +- 0.025 + 0.123 (1+w{\_}0) + 0.137 Omega{\_}K. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is Omega{\_}K=-0.010+-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

abstract = {We developed a modification to the calculation of the two-point correlation function commonly used in the analysis of large scale structure in cosmology. An estimator of the two-point correlation function is constructed by contrasting the observed distribution of galaxies with that of a uniformly populated random catalog. Using the assumption that the distribution of random galaxies in redshift is independent of angular position allows us to replace pairwise combinatorics with fast integration over probability maps. The new method significantly reduces the computation time while simultaneously increasing the precision of the calculation. It also allows to introduce cosmological parameters only at the last and least computationally expensive stage, which is helpful when exploring various choices for these parameters.},

@article{Taylor2013,
abstract = {Cosmological parameter estimation requires that the likelihood function of the data is accurately known. Assuming that cosmological large-scale structure power spectra data are multivariate Gaussian distributed, we show that the accuracy of parameter estimation is limited by the accuracy of the inverse data covariance matrix - the precision matrix. If the data covariance and precision matrices are estimated by sampling independent realizations of the data, their statistical properties are described by theWishart and inverse-Wishart distributions, respectively. Independent of any details of the survey, we show that the fractional error on a parameter variance, or a figure of merit, is equal to the fractional variance of the precision matrix. In addition, for the only unbiased estimator of the precision matrix, we find that the fractional accuracy of the parameter error depends only on the difference between the number of independent realizations and the number of data points, and so can easily diverge. For a 5 per cent error on a parameter error and ND « 102 data points, a minimum of 200 realizations of the survey are needed, with 10 per cent accuracy in the data covariance. If the number of data points ND » 102, we need NS {\textgreater} ND realizations and a fractional accuracy of {\textless} √2/ND in the data covariance. As the number of power spectra data points grows to ND {\textgreater} 104-106, this approach will be problematic. We discuss possible ways to relax these conditions: improved theoretical modelling, shrinkage methods, data compression, simulation and data resampling methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

@article{VargasMagana2013,
abstract = {Measuring the two-point correlation function of the galaxies in the Universe gives access to the underlying dark matter distribution, which is related to cosmological parameters and to the physics of the primordial Universe. The estimation of the correlation function for current galaxy surveys makes use of the Landy-Szalay estimator, which is supposed to reach minimal variance. This is only true, however, for a vanishing correlation function. We study the Landy-Szalay estimator when these conditions are not fulfilled and propose a new estimator that provides the smallest variance for a given survey geometry. Our estimator is a linear combination of ratios between paircounts of data and/or random catalogues (DD, RR and DR). The optimal combination for a given geometry is determined by using lognormal mock catalogues. The resulting estimator is biased in a model-dependent way, but we propose a simple iterative procedure for obtaining an unbiased model-independent estimator. Our method can be easily applied to any dataset and requires few extra mock catalogues compared to the standard Landy-Szalay analysis. Using various sets of simulated data (lognormal, second-order LPT and N-Body), we obtain a 20-25{\%} gain on the error bars on the two-point correlation function for the SDSS geometry and $\Lambda$CDM correlation function. When applied to SDSS data (DR7 and DR9), we achieve a similar gain on the correlation functions, which translates into a 10-15{\%} improvement over the estimation of the densities of matter Ωm and dark energy Ω$\Lambda$ in an open $\Lambda$CDM model. The constraints derived from DR7 data with our estimator are similar to those obtained with the DR9 data and the Landy-Szalay estimator, which covers a volume twice as large and has a density that is three times higher.},
